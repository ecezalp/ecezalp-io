[Why I Hate Frameworks](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.219431.12) This article is one that stayed with me over the years. It a funny post about the abstract factory design pattern. However, reading it again today, I noticed something new: the great waterfall of enterprise development. It is kind of crazy to me how developers received the planning and documentation of the features that they were supposed to write before they actually wrote the thing. I am not against architecture, design patterns, or Java in general - in fact, I quite like those things! But I would like to exercise my creativity as an engineer when implementing the solutions that are answering the requirements. 

[FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) Some more enterprise software humor. FizzBuzz is an old riddle in the programming lands, a question to see whether you can handle a most basic condition. Dive into the source code. It is actually kind of impressive and well written (had it served a point). This is a reminder that well written code can be "bad" too, if the logic is not appropriately refactored.  

[Worms-style cartoon terrain in JavaScript](https://juliango202.com/terrainver/?terrain=eyJ3IjoxNDM5LCJzZWVkIjowLjA5MDg0NDEyMDQ4OTU1MzgxLCJub2lzZSI6MzIsInR5cGUiOiJ0eXBlLTEiLCJjaGFyYXMiOjl9) I played Worms with my cousin a few times when I was growing up, we both loved the game. I really liked using the sample generator they have on the site, and I thought that their cute emoji "worms" were really adorable. 

[Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/) Sometimes you want to have some texture for a div, but you want it to be *subtle*. This is the perfect place to find those things. They are entirely CSS, which makes it very fast and easy to use. There is a lot of them, and if you are inspired, you can lightly (or heavily) edit them as well!

[Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) Apparently, Flaticon is the largest search engine of free icons in the world. I came accross this site when I was looking for some icons that were not Font Awesome. I use font awesome frequently, but sometimes you want to have a bit of color or something more interesting! Flaticon is great for that. I love one of the food icon collections (so adorable!) and they also have a pattern generator, which looks fantastic to add a fling to a site.
